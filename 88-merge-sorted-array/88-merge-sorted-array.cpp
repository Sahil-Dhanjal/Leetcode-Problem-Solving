// SOLUTION 01
// 1. We took j = 0 to iterate nums2 from the beginning.
// 2. As we know nums1 has a size of m+n & only first m elements should be in the final array.
// 3. So we replace all the elements from m index with all the elements of nums2.
// 4. Finally, weâ€™ll sort the array nums1 to get the final sorted array.
// Time complexity: O(nlogn) //as sorting takes nlogn time.
    
// Solution 02 [Optimized to the Previous Solution]
// 1. As both solutions 01 & 02 takes O(nlogn), now we try to solve it with O(n+m).
// 2. We will use the reverse sorting method.
// 3. We took 3 variables: i (last valid element of nums1 that will present in final array), j (last element of nums2) & k ( last index of nums1)
// 4. First, while loop will compare nums1 & nums2 and the greater element will be in nums1[k].
// 5. After the loop end if there is still any elements left in any array that will be added by next 2 while loop.
// Time complexity: O(m+n).
    
// AN ANOTHER APPROACH
// 1. Make a New vector nums with size (n+m)
// 2. if there were no elements in nums2, simply return as there's nothing to do to nums1
// 3. Otherwise, while both the pointers are withing their limits
// 4. We merge sort exactly how we conventionaly do [like inserting the sorted elements into the third vector]
// 5, Finally, copy the elements from nums vector to the nums1 vector and return.
// Time Complexity: O(m+n) but Space Complexity -> O(m+n)
    
// WE'LL BE USING THE REVERSE SORTING METHOD.
